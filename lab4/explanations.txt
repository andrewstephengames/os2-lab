Exercise 1:

Upon running the `make` command a second time, no order is executed, as make detects no change in the source files, and so it doesn't even update the timestamp of the executable.

When changing `MIN_VAL`, the executable's timestamp doesn't update because `make` doesn't do anything. This is because `make` only rebuilds the project when a source file is modified, not when a header file is.

If we include `utils.h` as a dependency for `tema.c`, the `make` utility will update the executable when modifying the header file.
